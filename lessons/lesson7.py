# Lesson 7 Looping Statements

# while loop
# Executes a set of statements until its condition is false

def basic_while(arg):
    alpha = arg
    while alpha < 4:
        print(alpha)
        # increment by 1
        alpha += 1


# basic_while(0)

# for loop
# Executes a set of statements as it iterates a collection or sequence
def basic_for(arg):
    for alpha in arg:
        print(alpha)


# basic_for('I like coding')

# nested for loop
# You can have a loop inside a loop. The inner loop can used the variable of
# the outer loop. Both must have different declared variables.
def basic_nested():
    for hop in range(1, 10):
        for bop in range(hop):
            print(hop, end=' ')
        print()
    print()


# basic_nested()

# range()
# This is used to return a sequence of numbers. This includes a start number,
# an end number, and increment
# single argument
def basic_single():
    for able in range(5):
        print(able)


# two arguments
def basic_double():
    for beta in range(2, 10):
        print(beta)


# basic_single()

# basic_double()

# three arguments
def basic_three():
    for charlie in range(0, 15, 2):
        print(charlie)


# basic_three()

# pass statement
# This allows a for loop to be created without a body.

for num in 'hello':
    pass


# break statement
# This is used in conjunction with an if statement to break from a loop
def basic_break(num):
    while num < 10:
        print(num)
        if num == 5:
            break
        num += 1


# basic_break(0)

# using a for loop
def basic_break_for():
    for value in 'Python':
        if value == 'h':
            break
        print(value)


# basic_break_for()

# continue statement
# This statement will stop an active iteration and begin the next one.
def basic_continue_for():
    for value in 'Python':
        if value == 'h':
            continue
        print(value)


# basic_continue_for()

# else statement
# Also used in loops, this statement can be used after the loop ends
def basic_else():
    thing1 = 0
    while thing1 < 4:
        print(thing1)
        thing1 += 1
    else:
        print('loop ends')
