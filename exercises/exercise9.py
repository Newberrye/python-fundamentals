# Problem #4 says exercises 9.1 to 9.11 but the page only has uo to 9.3. I'm
# assuming that was a typo.

# Write functions for each of the items below. Call the function to ensure
# the results are correct.

# 1.On page 137 of your book, do 8-3 through 8-5 of the Try it Yourself. Put
# all your code in your exercise9.py file.

# 8-3. T-Shirt: Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and
# the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function
# should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message
# printed on it.
# - Call the function once using positional arguments to make a
#   shirt.
# - Call the function a second time using keyword arguments.

# keywords

# 8-4. Large Shirts: Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are
# large by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large
# shirt and a medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size
# with a different message.

# Large shirt and medium shirt. Not using keyword for second function since
# first parameter is size.
make_shirt()
make_shirt('medium')

# Any size, different message
make_shirt(text='I despise Python!')

print()
# 8-5. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name
# of a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence,
# such as Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a
# default value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one
# of which is not in the default country.
