# 1. Hello World
# Can you make a typo that generates an error?
# pri nt('Hello World')
#   File "exercise1.py", line 1
#     pri nt('Hello World')
#         ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# Can you make sense of the error message?
# 'nt' is not a base function so there is no syntax for it

# Can you make a typo that doesnâ€™t generate an error?
# print("Helo World")
# Helo World

# Why do you think it didn't make an error?
# print is a valid function and PyCharm doesn't seem to have a base
# spellcheck for the string inside of print.


# 2. Zen of Python
# import this
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
