# simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# - Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

#   two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

#   been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
#   new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
#   that the username is available.
# - Make sure your comparison is case-insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
